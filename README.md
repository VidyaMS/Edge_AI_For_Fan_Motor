This repo is for analyzing accelerometer readings , to understand the Fan's normal operation Vs an anomaly.  
The data is obtained from https://github.com/ShawnHymel/tinyml-example-anomaly-detection.   
In the videos and articles , Shawn has explained how with a set up of  an MPU and an accelerometer attached on the Fan's motor, the motor's vibration data can be collected.    
Once collected , the data is analysed, and models are created for inferencing the data. i.e we learn patterns of the data. We can use simple statistics such as Mahalanobis distance or use deep learning to map the data.  Once done, these models are deployed on MPU using tensorflowlite.    
Once anomaly detection model is running on the MPU, the new accelerometer readings are input to the model and based on the predicted value i.e the new mahalanobis distance or the auto encoder prediction's metric such as the mean square error between the actual values and the predicted values, we can identify if the reading is well with in the normal values or is outside as an anomaly.
